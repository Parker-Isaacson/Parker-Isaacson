# Hi, I’m @Parker-Isaacson

I am a developer who likes to work on personal projects just to learn. Spend some time and look around, you might find a cool project. Feel free to reach out to me to ask about what I am working on, if you are interested in joining what I do, let me know! I am always happy to start working with new people. Check out my website [Parker Isaacson](https://github.parkerisaacson.com/)

### What Am I Working On?

- Bish: My own shell, play on bash.
  - In progress, adding piping.
 
### What Have I Done?

This is a reverse chronological list of the projects that I consider complete, though I may come back to them later! The projects that are *iltaicized* are repos that I may come back to and update later.

- *Qur*: C-Style compiled langauge.
  - Does not contain assembly, may be fixed later.
- *KeyTime*: C# Macroing software that permits the user to design macros in a timeline fashion.
  - Has some crashes due to uncaught exceptions, may be fixed later.
- 2025-Avangrid-Hackathon: Read a bit more about it online though the repo does come with provided files.
- xtts-finetune-cli: A CLI wrapper for the XTTS model, based off of [xtts-finetune-webui](https://github.com/daswer123/xtts-finetune-webui)
- *Render.md*: A markdown renderer, supports all markdown features as of August 24, 2025.
  - Might add my own markdown componenets.
- Snap Query: Tool that proivded efficent chat access with differnet browser-based AI models.
- Arch Installer 1 & 2: A C++ and sh based install for the Arch Linux Distrobution.

### Project Ideas

These are some breifs on what I want to work on, breif descriptions as I don't quite know the scope yet.

- Shell ( I am working on this, those below this are tied to it )
  - Kernel
  - Bootloader
  - OS
- Cheat Enginge Remake
  - To understand more about reading and processing memory.
- Graphical Design tool
  - Something like [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) or [Lunacy](https://icons8.com/lunacy), though free and open source.
  - Main goal is to have it export to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so what is designed can just be pasted into a webpage.
- Interpreted Lanague
  - Something pythonic, though likely with type safety and braces.
- Photo Grader
  - Either use AI/ML to score photos so after a photoshoot you can just edit the good ones.
  - Use math and interpret qualities like brightness, contrast, exposure to determine score.
- Database
  - Will likely just be another parser... though for SQL this time.
- Webserver
  - NGINX or Apache remake, just to get more into baremetal ideas.
