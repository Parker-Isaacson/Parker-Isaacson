# Hi, Iâ€™m @Parker-Isaacson

I am a developer who likes to work on personal projects just to learn. Spend some time and look around, you might find a cool project. Feel free to reach out to me to ask about what I am working on, if you are interested in joining what I do, let me know! I am always happy to start working with new people.

## What Am I Working On?

I am currently working on two projects:

- WynnCalc
  - What will hopefully be an open source project that automates the process of finding builds for the game [Wynncraft](https://wynncraft.com/), this will take a lot of insparation from [Wynnbuilder](https://wynnbuilder.github.io/), as through the equations and methods used. However I'd like something to be made that is neetly documented and easy to jump in and work on. I've got some big goals for this project, hopeing that I can reduce the time players spend looking for the best possible build, making it so they can actually play the game more. Maybe I'll even discover some unknown, very powerful builds!
  - This project will hopefully be writen in Python, and if turned into a website, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will liekly be used ( or maybe it will jsut refence the python ).
- Markdown-Render
  - This is a project aimed at recreating and mainting a tool that can render markdown to html locally, I want this to be packed with features that I just cant find anywhere else. If possible I'd like to be able to include this in differnet web-dev things that I make, as I love adding new style to what I do.
  - This project will be writen in C++, upon completion it will aslo be ported to other langauges incluing python and JavaScript.
