# Hi, Iâ€™m @Parker-Isaacson

I am a developer who likes to work on personal projects just to learn. Spend some time and look around, you might find a cool project. Feel free to reach out to me to ask about what I am working on, if you are interested in joining what I do, let me know! I am always happy to start working with new people.

## What Am I Working On?

I have no currenty projects. Render.md has finished and is just going to get updates when I find issues with it, and after discovering that WynnCalc would need to compute a ~700 sextillion builds I've choosen to drop it.
